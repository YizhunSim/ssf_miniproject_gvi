# Dependecies

- The Spring Web - The Spring Web Starter dependency pulls all dependencies relating to web development. With the Spring Starter Web dependency, we can create a controller in our Spring Boot application that allows the application to be accessed over the internet.

- Lombok - The Lombok dependency simplifies the project. By adding a single annotation, you can create your getters, setters, equals, toString and hashCode methods under the hood. Lombok also comes with an Slf4j logger which you will use many times in the project.

- Validation - The Spring Starter Validation dependency provides support for validating user input. With the Spring Starter Validation dependency, we can provide constraints to target fields by using annotations.
