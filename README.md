# Dependecies

- The Spring Web - The Spring Web Starter dependency pulls all dependencies relating to web development. With the Spring Starter Web dependency, we can create a controller in our Spring Boot application that allows the application to be accessed over the internet.

- Lombok - The Lombok dependency simplifies the project. By adding a single annotation, you can create your getters, setters, equals, toString and hashCode methods under the hood. Lombok also comes with an Slf4j logger which you will use many times in the project.

- Validation - The Spring Starter Validation dependency provides support for validating user input. With the Spring Starter Validation dependency, we can provide constraints to target fields by using annotations.

- RediSearch
  RediSearch is a source-available module for querying, secondary indexing, and full-text search in Redis. Redisearch implements a secondary index in Redis, but unlike other Redis indexing libraries, it does not use internal data structures such as sorted sets. This also enables more advanced features, such as multi-field queries, aggregation, and full-text search. Also, RediSearch supports exact phrase matching and numeric filtering for text queries, neither possible nor efficient with traditional Redis indexing approaches. Having a rich query and aggregation engine in your Redis database opens the door to many new applications that go well beyond caching. You can use Redis as your primary database even when you need to access the data using complex queries without adding complexity to the code to update and index data.
